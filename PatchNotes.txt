Key Master AddOn for World of Warcraft
(c) 2024 â€“ Released under the GNU General Public License

PATCH NOTES:
--------------------------------------------------
Key Master Beta release v0.0.96-beta
--------------------------------------------------
- Fixed grammatical errors
- Update interface version 100206 for 10.2.6

Key Master Beta release v0.0.95-beta
--------------------------------------------------
- Added decimal preferences to several locations: score calculator, tally data,
  and personal gain row.
- Reset score calculator when re-opening the player panel
- Added QOL querying of keystone and overall rating information for party members without
  Key Master installed from the commonly used Open Raid library (if they have another
  addon with openRaid installed: i.e. Details, etc.). This is not always dependable or
  guaranteed to be accurate, but it's the best alternative for non-addon party member 
  information; at least, for the time being.
- Replaced "Key Master Not Detected!" text with an icon on the party frame for
  party members without Key Master installed.
- Fixed Key Master icon showing up as a "?" in the in-game AddOn List. Now shows correct icon.
- The Key Master window's position is now saved between logins/reloads.
- Updated the Key Master main "Theme" color to Key Master Gold.
- Added a minimap icon
- Added minimap icon show/hide option to configuration screen.
- Changed the season display in the main header to reflect the current expansion season
  instead of the WoW lifetime season.
- Added additional back-end functionality for upcoming language localization.
- Cleaned up some cross-server compatibility concerns - Key Master "should" now work no differently
  between same server and cross-server parties.
