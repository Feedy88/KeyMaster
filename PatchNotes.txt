Key Master AddOn for World of Warcraft
(c) 2024 â€“ Released under the GNU General Public License

PATCH NOTES:
--------------------------------------------------
Key Master Beta release v0.0.95-beta
--------------------------------------------------
- Added decimal preferences to score calculator
- Added decimal preference to party tally data on party panel
- Reset score calculator when re-opening the player panel
- Added QOL querying of keystone and overall rating information for party members without
  Key Master installed from the commonly used Open Raid library (if they have another
  addon with openRaid installed: i.e. Details, etc.). This is not always dependable or
  guaranteed to be accurate, but it's the best alternative for non-addon party member 
  information; at least, for the time being.
- Added decimal preference to personal gain row on party panel
- Replaced "Key Master Not Detected!" text with an icon on the party frame for
  players without Key Master installed.
- Fixed Key Master icon showing up as a "?" in the in-game AddOn List. Now shows correct icon.
- The Key Master window's position is now saved between logins/reloads.
- Updated the Key Master main "Theme" color to Key Master Gold.
- Added a minimap icon
- Added minimap icon show/hide option to configuration screen.
- Because the current overall WoW season number is not marketed (i.e. Season 11) and the expansion
  season is (i.e. Dragonflight Season 3) -but is not available from the API-, we've replaced the
  overall season number in the main header with the current expansion name. (no season info) to
  reduce confusion.
