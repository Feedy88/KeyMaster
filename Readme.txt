About:
Key Master is an addon developed for World of Warcraft that assists in
gathering and displaying detailed information about you and your parties “live”
(if they also have Key Master) data relating to Mythic Plus Instances.
This addon was conceived with the idea that it was too laborious to make
well-informed decisions regarding “Key Running”; either for yourself, or a
“push team”.

While there are many future features in-mind for Key Master to expand its
usefulness, how far it may go and when that will happen is largely dependent on
its user base. So, if you find Key Master useful, tell your friends!
